NaN - Not a Number - is an advanced AI-driven technology that revolutionizes aquatic life monitoring, emphasizing a humane and attentive approach to fish care. Using machine learning and computer vision, NaN analyzes high-quality video footage to detect normal and abnormal fish behavior. It employs video segmentation techniques, advanced models, and motion analysis tools to ensure accurate species recognition and behavioral analysis. The system also utilizes Isolation Forest algorithms for anomaly detection and features an intuitive user interface for accessibility. NaN represents a commitment to changing the way we care for aquatic life by treating each fish as a unique individual, not just a statistic, setting a new standard in aquatic monitoring with a blend of technology and compassion.
